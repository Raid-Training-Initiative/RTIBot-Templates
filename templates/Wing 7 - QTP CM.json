  "description": "> *After the events in the Mystic Forge, Qadim has returned home to the Hidden City of Ahdashim to usurp a great power. Seek the Key and the cardinals for guidance into the hallowed city walls and stop Qadim from destroying not only the djinn, but also the natural balance of the world.*\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This is a Raid CM Training Run so we require that you have done all of the planned encounters before on **normal mode** at least once on the role you sign up for.\n\nThis is a **Challenge Mode** run of the last boss of The Key of Ahdashim (Wing 7), <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless CM**, which is a somewhat difficult and complex boss.\n\nBoth power and condi DPS work for this encounter!\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- One healer will need to **Tank**. <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless CM** hits like a truck, so I recommend you to take a good amount toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's`.\n- The other healer will be expected to do the `Anomalies` mechanic, which requires a bit of ranged hard/soft CC.\n\n<:quick_generic:1176639827890937986> <:alac_generic:1176639824292220958> **Boon Roles:**\n- Two boon providers will need to take **Stability**, which requires giving your subgroup <:stability:844163847161774121> **Stability** to protect from the knockbacks on <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless CM**, which is handy on normal mode but sometimes absolutely crucial for CM!\n\n<:dps:1176639819191951390> **DPS Roles:**\n- Three DPS will be expected to do the `Pylon Kiting` mechanic. The only three builds that can reliably perform the role are <:scourge:763701209122471958> **[Condition Scourge](https://snowcrows.com/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition-scourge)**, <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **[Condition Virtuoso](https://snowcrows.com/builds/mesmer/virtuoso/condition-virtuoso)**, and <:deadeye:818854511342780416> **[Rifle Deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/builds/thief/deadeye/kite-deadeye)**. Check our POVs in <#1053246449212739604> for a demonstration. The CM makes this role slightly more punishing.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
