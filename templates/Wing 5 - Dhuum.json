  "description": "> *An influx of murderous undead relentlessly hunt innocent worshipers of Grenth. Infiltrate the Underworld and join the struggle for control over the fates of the living and the dead.*\n\nThis is a run specifically for the last boss of Hall of Chains (Wing 5), <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**, which is a very difficult boss that slightly favours condi DPS.\n\nBoth power and condi DPS work for this encounter!\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- One healer will need to take **Tank + G3**. Tanking on <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum** is toughness-based, so you're expected to take some toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's` to take aggro. They will also be expected to do `Green 3`.\n- The other healer will be on **Kiter + G2**. They will be expected to do `Green 2` and `Kiting`.\n\n<:dps:1176639819191951390> **DPS Roles:**\n- The DPS that takes **G1** is expected to do `Green 1`.\n- The DPS that takes **Boonstrip** is expected to take a class that can strip boons from the boss.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
