  "description": "> *The dragon cycle that has sustained and blighted Tyria for ages is collapsing. Mortal hearts and choices will define this moment in history—and echo in the future forever.*\n\nWe will be tackling the third EoD Strike CM, <:ministerli:954126378364715059> **Kaineng Overlook CM**, which is one of the hardest encounters in the game right now that requires fast reflexes and good coordination.\n\nBoth power and condi DPS work for this encounter, but condi *tends* to perform better and ranged + piercing damage is extremely helpful.\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- Both healers will need to take the **Kiter** role to handle the `Orange Line` mechanic coming from the Sniper. This role requires good self sustain and survivability, so I strongly recommend bringing with you a lot of toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's`.\n- One healer will need to take the **Enforcer Tank** role. This requires that you take the Enforcer at the start of the phase and move it to the middle. Healer classes that can give boons to the group from afar are preferred for this role.\n- Another healer will need to take the **Mindblade Tank** role. This is a very simple role where you stand near the Mindblade at the start of the phase and move it to the group.\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:quick_dps:1176639849156051014> **Quickness Roles:**\n- Both quickness providers will need to take the **Stability** role. They will be expected to provide <:stability:844163847161774121> **Stability** to their subgroup for the boss's dragon slash attack.\n\n<:dps:1176639819191951390> **DPS Roles:**\n- One DPS will need to take the **Mech Tank** role. This is a difficult and punishing role of tanking the Mech Rider during the Sniper/Mech phase by being the closest to it AND in front of it at all times. The DPS class you come on has to have a long-range blink and ideally some self survivability. <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **Virtuoso** is by far the best for this. I would also strongly recommend practising this in the `In the Name of the Law` story instance or (ideally) in normal mode pugs before joining if you've never done it before.\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: I strongly recommend that everyone comes with a `Jade Bot Core: Tier 10` (or as high as you can get the tier to be). There are hard-hitting attacks in this fight that you may have to facetank which the extra vitality helps with.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
