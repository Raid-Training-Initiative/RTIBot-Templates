  "description": "> *You've faced the ghosts of Spirit Vale and uncovered the truth behind Salvation Pass; now the final steps of your journey lie before you. Prepare to enter the Stronghold of the Faithful and challenge the White Mantle in their own territory. Cut through to the heart of their plans, or you and your allies may be lost forever to their twisted magic.*\n\nThis is the third raid and final wing of the Forsaken Thicket. We will have four encounters:\n<:escort:841311758147911742> **Escort** - An easy encounter with a lot of mobs.\n<:keepconstruct:703930783223644200> **Keep Construct** - An easy bursty boss that favours power DPS.\n<:twistedcastle:703930902840868914> **Twisted Castle**- A confusing maze-like encounter.\n<:xera:703930902069117008> **Xera** - A medium difficulty boss where condi or power DPS both work.\n\nWe strongly recommend coming on power DPS for at least <:keepconstruct:703930783223644200> **Keep Construct**.\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- One healer will need to **Tank** on <:keepconstruct:703930783223644200> **Keep Construct** and <:xera:703930902069117008> **Xera**. Tanking is toughness-based, so you're expected to take some toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's` to take aggro.\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This wing requires the **[Ley Line Gliding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley_Line_Gliding)** mastery! Do not join unless you have this mastery unlocked.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
