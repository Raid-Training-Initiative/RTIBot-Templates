  "description": "> *Zommoros has invited you to participate in the very first private tour of the Mystic Forge. Witness the incredible inner workings of the djinn's magical domain, and uncover the dark secret that lurks at its center.*\n\nThis is a **Challenge Mode** run of the last boss of the Mythwright Gambit (Wing 6), <:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim CM**, which is one of the hardest raid encounters in the game currently. This encounter introduces many more `oneshot orbs` that bounce around the arena regularly during the legendary mob phases. You will also instantly die if you fall down, and various other parts of the fight are not insignificantly different to the normal mode version (harder `Lamp` and more HP on the boss, to name a few).\n\nPlease note that power DPS is **required** in this run for <:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim CM** due to the pyre strategy we'll be doing.\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- One healer will be expected to take the **Tank** role. They will be the main tank the hydra, destroyer, and one of the wyverns. Tanking is proximity-based, but we still recommend some toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's`.\n- The other healer will be taking the **Off-Tank** role. This means they will tank the `Matriarch` or `Partiarch` wyvern.\n\n<:dps:1176639819191951390> **DPS Roles:**\n- A DPS will take the **Pull** role. Only <:mesmer:675414199211393036> **Mesmer** DPS builds are qualified to do this. They will be pulling the `Magma Elementals` with focus.\n- Two DPS players will take the **Portal** role. They will be using `Portals` on <:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim CM**. Only <:mesmer:675414199211393036> **Mesmer** and <:thief:675414199475634211> **Thief** DPS builds are qualified to do this.\n- A DPS will take **Kiter** role. They will do the `Kiting` mechanic.\n- Another DPS will take the **Lamp** role. They will be expected to do the first two `Lamp` mechanics alone. The lamp is a bit harder on CM so we may send a second person in with you if you take this role.\n\n<:contacts:1181934601040576512> **Roles Anyone Can Choose:**\n- Two people will need to take the **Aegis** role to give <:aegis:766683009309999104> **Aegis** to each subgroup to protect the squad from the `oneshot orbs` mechanic.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
