  "description": "> *After the events in the Mystic Forge, Qadim has returned home to the Hidden City of Ahdashim to usurp a great power. Seek the Key and the cardinals for guidance into the hallowed city walls and stop Qadim from destroying not only the djinn, but also the natural balance of the world.*\n\nThis is the seventh raid wing which serves as a plot continuation of Wing 6. It is a beginner-friendly and medium difficulty wing. We will have four encounters:\n<:gate:756822812450226186> **Gate** - A trivially easy encounter that serves as a pre-event to the wing.\n<:adina:703930780610461806> **Cardinal Adina** - A medium difficulty boss that requires you to be quick on your feet.\n<:sabir:703930783160860722> **Cardinal Sabir** - A medium difficulty boss that requires a lot of CC.\n<:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless** - A fairly difficult, complicated boss where any kind of DPS works.\n\nBoth power and condi DPS work for these encounters!\n\n<:quick_healer:1176639812900495400> <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Healer Roles:**\n- One healer will need to **Tank** on <:adina:703930780610461806> **Cardinal Adina** and <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless**. Tanking is toughness-based for <:adina:703930780610461806> **Cardinal Adina**, and <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless** hits like a truck, so I recommend you to take a good amount toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's`.\n- The other healer will be expected to do the `Anomalies` mechanic on <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless**, which requires a bit of ranged hard/soft CC.\n\n<:dps:1176639819191951390> **DPS Roles:**\n- Three DPS will be expected to do the `Pylon Kiting` mechanic on <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless**.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
